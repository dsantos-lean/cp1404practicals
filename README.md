# Repository for CP1404 Practicals

## Lean Delos Santos, Student: Bachelor of Information Technology (TR3)

This repository is where I learn programming and put my CP1404 practical codes.

3 main lessons:

- Clean code is readable code, even for non-programmers.
- Clean code is best practice, it makes maintenance and collaborations easier.
- You can go back to your codes after 10 years and still understand what they do.
